      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>We are a group of undergraduate students who came together to create a web tool that would attempt to solve or mitigate a problem we have seen. The overall problem that we are addressing is Amazonâ€™s control over other businesses as well as their impact on the environment. Online retailers used to depend on Amazon to sell their goods online, but now more and more are leaving to sell their products online independently. Stores such as Nike, Vans, Patagonia, as well as smaller businesses that may have no choice but to sell their products with Amazon do not want to rely on Amazon to support their business. Buying from Amazon also creates much more waste compared to that of going to a local business in town and buying the same or similar product in person. We have attempted to solve these problems by making it easy for someone browsing Amazon to choose to shop more locally, while also highlighting the benefits of buying locally. While Amazon is definitly not the only offender, we chose to focus on them because of how many users they have. As of 2021, Amazon has over 200 million Prime subscribers. This does not even account for non-Prime users who still order from Amazon. We also do not want to take business away from independent sellers on Amazon, so we notify the user of the original seller of the product, and give them the optoin to search online to see if that seller has there own online store. By creating this tool, we hope that people can more easily find stores located near them to buy from, or buy directly from independent sellers rather than buying through Amazon.</p>
